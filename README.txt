To play this piece:

  1) Open Main.pd in Pd (http://puredata.info), and
  2) Click the message box at the top.

Despite the large number of audio files, only one of them is currently
actually used (audioFiles/sung/harmonics/03.aif). (Sorry for the excess.)

This patch is a thin wrapper for polySampler.pd, which in turn is copied
almost verbatim from an example patch that comes with the Pd distribution
(D11.sampler.poly.pd). The specific changes are enumerated as a comment
at the top of polySampler.pd.

The piece is read by Pd as a qlist of messages which create notes based
on the abovementioned audio sample file. The qlist (qlist.txt) was
generated by generate.xsl (using the Saxon XSLT 2.0 processor).
generate.xsl contains all the actual compositional logic.
