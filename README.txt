To play this piece:

  1) Open Main.pd in Pd (http://puredata.info), and
  2) Click the message box at the top.

This piece gets all its audio from one sample file
(audioFiles/sung/harmonics/03.aif), in which I'm singing a single note
and playing with the natural harmonics of my voice. These get accentuated
at different junctures in the piece.

The Pd patch is a thin wrapper for polySampler.pd, which in turn is copied
almost verbatim from an example patch that comes with the Pd distribution
(D11.sampler.poly.pd). The specific changes are enumerated in a comment
at the top of polySampler.pd.

The piece is scored as a qlist of messages which create notes based
on the abovementioned audio sample file. The qlist (qlist.txt) was
generated by generate.xsl (using the Saxon XSLT 2.0 processor).
generate.xsl contains all the actual compositional logic. See it for
more detailed comments regarding the choices made.
